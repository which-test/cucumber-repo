#To run
This codebase was developed with ruby 2.2.4p214 so all the methods and syntax are running on ruby 2.XX

Make sure that chromedriver is installed before running the tests - which I did on my Mac with 'brew install chromedriver'
Also install bundler as a gem and you should be able to execute the tests by running 'bundle exec cucumber'

Have run the the code with some static code analyzer like rubocop and rubycritic as well
